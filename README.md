This Python script, aptly named `file_access_monitor.py`, is a tool designed for monitoring file access events and providing GPIO control, with a particular focus on the use with the HDClicker to get hard drive sounds from the activity of an emulators hard drive image. It can also be used to make a led light up based on the activity of a hard drive image that an emulator like pcem og fs-uae use. 

Developed to use the Raspberry Pi Pico for GPIO on computers which don't have gpio. The Pico needs to be flashed with the picod daemon : http://abyz.me.uk/picod/download.html

**Features:**

-   **Inotify-based File Monitoring:** Leveraging the power of the `pyinotify` module, the script keeps an eye on a specified file path for access events.
    
-   **GPIO Control:** Integrated with the `picod` module, the script triggers GPIO signals, allowing seamless integration with hardware components such as LEDs. This feature enables immediate visual feedback when the monitored file is accessed.
    
-   **Versatile Application:** While the script serves as a general-purpose file access monitor with GPIO control, it has been tailored for use with HDClicker, making it an ideal companion for projects involving this product (example: emulators).
    

**Usage:**

1.  **Hardware Requirements:** Ensure compatibility with platforms like Raspberry Pi Pico.
    
2.  **Dependencies:** Install the necessary Python modules using `pip install pyinotify picod`.
    
3.  **File Specification:** Set the file path to be monitored by modifying the `file_path` variable in the script.
    
4.  **Run the Script:** Execute the script to commence monitoring. Observe GPIO signals and printed outputs (1 for access, 0 for no access) based on file interactions.
    

**Example:**

    `python file_access_monitor.py` 

Or if you want it to start at bootup simply add it to crontab (or make a systemd startupscript)

    crontab -e

    @reboot /full/path/to/python /full/path/to/file_access_monitor.py
